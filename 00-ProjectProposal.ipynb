    "Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when blood glucose levels are too high. This is caused by either the pancreas not producing the hormone insulin or insulin receptors becoming unresponsive. Diabetes affects 1 in 10 Americans, with almost half of these cases remaining undiagnosed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have attempted to utilize machine learning to predict diabetes incidence in patients by using clinical data both simple (blood pressure, BMI) to those more difficult to measure (adiposity, HbA1c, lipid profiles). These algorithms have achieved high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is estimated than up to 25% of US adults skip annual healthcare checkups and up to 90% delay them. For these reasons, there are a number of at-risk patients who do not have up to date clinical data, let alone actual blood glucose tests. This project attempts to see if an accurate diabetes test could be developed using only lifestyle data that any person would know about themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one study that has looked at this before called \"Learning from the machine: is diabetes in adults predicted by lifestyle variables? A retrospective predictive modelling study of NHANES 2007–2018.\" This paper uses an XGBoost model and claims a promisingly high accuracy of prediction. However, this paper does little to interpret its results, such as quantifying which factors exactly are most predictive and concerns of equity (especially socioeconomic equity) could affect diabetes prevalence. This seems to us a critical gap in the literature that could give important insight into the development of diabetes and its eventual health burden."
